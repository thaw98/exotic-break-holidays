            Treat yourself to the ultimate break by escaping to one of our
            exotic holiday destinations. Imagine lying on a white sandy beach
            with coconut palms swaying in the breeze, cocktails at hand and the
            smell of spice in the air.
          </p>
          <p>
            Exotic destinations such as the <b>Caribbean</b> are ever more
            accessible and just waiting to be discovered by you.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Exotic Breaks</b> can also take you off the beaten track and lead
            you to discover all that the Far East and Asia have to offer.
            Combine adventure with relaxation and head into the Indian Ocean and
            the islands of the Maldives.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the summer months, why not try a little adventure and fly to
            Kenya to experience a breathtaking safan, During July and August the
            water level is lower and wild animals flock to water holes making
            the sighting of incerdible beasts such as lions, elephants and zebra
            even more likely for onlookers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whatever exotic break you are craving, the perfect solution is out
            there for you!
